# capstone-1
This is my first Capstone Project, an assessment to complete as a part of my  Bootcamp with HyperionDev. It lets a user calculate interest (simple and compound) or monthly mortgage bonds.
This used the knowledge gained on variables and conditional statements.

The code first asks the user to input 'bond' or 'investment'

If the user types in investment, they will be asked for:
* The amount to be deposited
* The number of years to invest
* The interest rate as a %
It will then ask the user do they want to calculate compound or interest rates
If it is simple, it will use the formula to calculate simple interest and print it
If it is compound, it will use the formula for compound interest and print it

If the user types in bond, they will be asked for:
* The present value of the house
* The annual interest rate
* How many months the user plans on paying back
The code will then calculate the monthly repayments and print them
